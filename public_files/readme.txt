B/c of space limitations I am limited to upload specific files. 

The zip file is the Syndeep CeDAMar csv as it was gievn to me by Dr. Camilo Mora ~ 2014. I can not gurantee it represents the database as in the publication: 

"Stuart, Carol T., et al. "CeDAMar global database of abyssal biological sampling." Aquatic biology 4 (2008): 143-145." 

However they should be one and the same, and one should use that publictaion when refering to the dataset.
