This directory contains scripts I am working on for my masters thesis.
best if you read them in a  second level text reader, as the ".py" indicates they are python scripts and  python syntax will be color coded. The sub directory contains scripts I have used, but are of less use, think main figure vs obscure supplements.

Given the expected number of people actually looking at these files, I haven't done much in terms of proof-reading for tyographical  errors or spelling in comments.
